# Collision-Detection-Using-Yolov7

Collision detection is a critical aspect of many applications, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, and video games. This project aims to leverage the power of the YOLOv7 algorithm for real-time collision detection.

YOLOv7, an evolution of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of object detection algorithms, is known for its ability to detect objects in images with high speed and accuracy. In this project, we train a YOLOv7 model to detect potential collisions in a given video.
